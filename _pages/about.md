I'm a third-year undergraduate studying computer science and statistics at the <a href='https://www.utoronto.ca'>University of Toronto</a>. Iâ€™m broadly interested in computer vision and machine learning, and particularly in 3D reconstruction, probabilistic modeling, and deep learning. I'm currently working with <a href='https://davidlindell.com'>David B. Lindell</a> and <a href='https://www.gilitschenski.org/igor/'>Igor Gilitschenski</a> on something about <a href='https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf'>NeRF</a>.

Previously, I was fortunate to work with <a href='http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kyros/'>Kyros Kutulakos</a> on computational imaging. I also did some research with <a href='https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/cms/lisa-jeffrey'>Lisa Jeffrey</a> and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/csealfon/?originalSubdomain=ca'>Carolyn Sealfon</a>, and worked as a web developer with <a href='https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~david/'>David Liu</a>.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing badminton and reading.

<!-- Hello, 
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
