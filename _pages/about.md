I recently graduated from the University of Toronto with a Computer Science Specialist and a Math Minor. I am broadly interested in computer vision and graphics. Currently, I am working with Prof. <a href='https://vilab.epfl.ch/zamir/'>Amir Zamir</a> at EPFL.

Previously, I had the opportunity to work with Prof. <a href='https://geometry.stanford.edu/member/guibas/'>Leonidas J. Guibas</a>, Prof. <a href='https://www.sfu.ca/~keli/'>Ke Li</a>, Prof. <a href='https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=TwMib_QAAAAJ&hl=en'>Luc Van Gool</a>, Prof. <a href='https://insait.ai/dr-danda-paudel/'>Danda Pani Paudel</a>, Prof. <a href='https://davidlindell.com'>David B. Lindell</a>, Prof. <a href='https://www.gilitschenski.org/igor/'>Igor Gilitschenski</a>, and Prof. <a href='http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kyros/'>Kyros Kutulakos</a>.

I spent one year at <a href='https://www.deepgenomics.com'>Deep Genomics</a> as a machine learning researcher. Earlier in my undergraduate studies, I conducted research with <a href='https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/cms/lisa-jeffrey'>Lisa Jeffrey</a> and worked as a web developer with Prof. <a href='https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~david/'>David Liu</a>.

I am passionate about mentoring junior students and helping them explore research opportunities at UofT and beyond. If you ever want to chat about research (or anything else!), feel free to reach out: <a href="mailto:junru.lin@mail.utoronto.ca">junru.lin@mail.utoronto.ca</a>.

<span style="color: red;">I'm actively looking for research internship opportunities starting Fall 2025!</span>

<!-- Hello, 
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
