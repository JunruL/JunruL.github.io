I'm a final-year undergraduate studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Toronto. Iâ€™m broadly interested in computer vision and graphics, with a particular focus on 3D reconstruction, probabilistic modeling, and deep learning. Currently, I'm working with Prof. <a href='https://geometry.stanford.edu/member/guibas/'>Leonidas J. Guibas</a> and Prof. <a href='https://www.sfu.ca/~keli/'>Ke Li</a> on exciting projects in 3D vision.

Previously, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Prof. <a href='https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=TwMib_QAAAAJ&hl=en'>Luc Van Gool</a> and Dr. <a href='https://insait.ai/dr-danda-paudel/'>Danda Pani Paudel</a> on NeRF-SLAM. My research journey in 3D vision began under the guidance of Prof. <a href='https://davidlindell.com'>David B. Lindell</a> and Prof. <a href='https://www.gilitschenski.org/igor/'>Igor Gilitschenski</a>. I also had the pleasure of working with Prof. <a href='http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kyros/'>Kyros Kutulakos</a> on computational imaging.

I gained industry experience through a year-long internship as a machine learning researcher at <a href='https://www.deepgenomics.com'>Deep Genomics</a>/. Earlier in my undergrad studies, I conducted research with <a href='https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/cms/lisa-jeffrey'>Lisa Jeffrey</a> and Prof. <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/csealfon/?originalSubdomain=ca'>Carolyn Sealfon</a>, and worked as a web developer with Prof. <a href='https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~david/'>David Liu</a>.

I am passionate about mentoring junior students and helping them explore research opportunities at UofT and beyond. If you ever want to chat about research (or anything else!), feel free to reach out: <a href="mailto:junru.lin@mail.utoronto.ca">junru.lin@mail.utoronto.ca</a>.

<!-- Hello, 
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
