  abstract={The COIVD pandemic has swept the globe since 2019, posing a grave threat to human life. There are multiple ways for the government to control the pandemic, including promoting the vaccination, limiting the number of people in public places, requiring people to wear masks in public places, and suggesting infected people isolate themselves. In this paper, we used a compartmental model to analyze the spread of COVID-19 under the promotion of rapid tests. The result shows that popularization of rapid tests may have a significant impact on controlling the pandemic. With an estimated minimum requirement for the use of rapid tests, we are able to put forward suggestions on reasonable ways to curtail the pandemic.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
